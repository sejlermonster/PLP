This project has dealt with implementing a multi paradigm drawing application. This has successfully been accomplished. 

In the Scheme implementation different recursive strategies have been used as well as higher-order programming. It was shown that tail recursion was necessary to avoid stack overflow for some functions and it allowed compiler optimization. 

A well structured C\# WPF application was developed to allow user interaction. MVVM ensured a loosely coupled view and viewmodel. Furthermore dependency injection was used and classes only depended on interfaces.

The complete application was thoroughly unit tested within different boundary cases. The test cases revealed unexpected behavior which was corrected. 

In general scheme as a programming language and the functional paradigm has shown how it can facilitate fast calculation and impressive optimization of tail recursion. Furthermore creating stateless functions can be seen as an advantage in numerous projects, especially concurrent systems where shared variables can be complex. Combining a functional language with an imperative language made it simple to keep the state of user interface and the two languages together has proven a strong combination.
