\chapter{Implementation} 
\label{chp:impl}

This chapter explain the implementation of the application.

\section{Multi paradigm}
The application uses the functional programming language Scheme together with the imperative language C\#. This is done by using \emph{IronScheme} which is an implementation of Scheme that targets .NET. This allows to call Scheme functions directly from C\# code and hence combine the use of the two languages.

This allowed... made it possible... something

\section{User interface in C\# WPF}
For developing the graphical user interface C\# and WPF was used. This made it possible to create the required interface that allowed the user to call scheme functions and have the objects drawn. 

Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) was used to separate the graphical user interface from the business logic.  This ensured that the busines logic was very loosely coupled with the view through data-binding and therefore easier to test. The is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:mvvm}

Furthermore a bootstrapper was used for constructor injection. All classes that needs to be constructor injected was given a appropriate interface to ensure testability.

A bitmap was used to draw on. This made it possible to draw single pixels that was returned from the scheme functions.

\section{Drawing Engine in Scheme}
Scheme was used for developing the drawing engine. This allowed for fast and stateless computation of the graphics being shown in the user interface.
