In this chapter will the implementation and test decisions be discussed. 

In the applicaton, the Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm was used for drawing a line. This algorithm is not able of drawing vertical lines only slopes. This was solved by adding functionality to the algorithm so it could draw this. In the first implementation of the algorithm it could not handle lines where the x value of the second point was greater than the x value in the first point. This was solve by checking the two values, and switch them, if the x value of the second point was greatest.


At the start all functions was implemented with classic recursion. This led to some functions causing stack overflow. to resolve tail recursion was used. This turn out in an effective way. The reason for this, is that tail recursion allows the compiler to optimize and avoid to allocate a new stack frame for each recursive call. 

It was choosing not to keep the bounding-box state in Scheme, because it would violate the basic principles in functional programming. By not saving the state of the bounding-box in scheme we insure no side effects. Instead the state of the bounding box was saved in C\#
