\label{chp:intro}

This report together with the developed application \emph{Graphikos} solves the given assignment: \emph{PLPA course work: Documents with graphics and text} given in the course \emph{Programming Language Paradigms}.

The application that has been developed can be used for drawing lines, rectangles, circles and text. The drawing engine is programmed in the functional programming language Scheme while the graphical user interface is developed in the imperative programming language C\#. 

This report will explain how the two programming languages have been used together to fulfil the the requirements of the assignment. Furthermore different implementation examples will be given and discussed while the chosen test strategy will also be explained.
