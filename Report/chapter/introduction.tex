This report and the developed application \emph{Graphikos} solves the assignment given in the course \emph{Programming Language Paradigms}.

The application which has been developed can be used for drawing lines, rectangles, circles and text. The application must also be able to set a bounding-box which all other objects must be within. The drawing engine is programmed in the functional programming language, Scheme, while the graphical user interface is developed in the imperative language C\#. 

This report will explain how the two programming languages have been used together to fulfill the requirements of the assignment. Furthermore different implementation examples will be given and discussed while the chosen test strategy will also be explained.
