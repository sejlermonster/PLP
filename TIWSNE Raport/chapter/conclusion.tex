This project has dealt with implementing an application for transferring an image with and without compression. This has successfully been accomplished. Even though some improvements have been identified the implementation has been able to solve both basic requirements and advanced study.

A project was developed for transferring an image from a PC to a TelosB mote. The TelosB mote could then transfer the image to another mote. This mote would then transfer the image to a PC. The PC would then reconstruct the image in a Java application. The transferring of the image could be done non-compressed as well as compressed. 

Three different compression algorithms has been implemented a 1, 2 and 4-bit compression. Using these compressions resulted in lower transmission time and lower energy consumption.  

The advantages of using compression was furthermore discussed and it was also noted that lossless and lossy compression has different advantages. Choosing lossy, lossless or no compression depends on the requirements
