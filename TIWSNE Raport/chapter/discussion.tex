\label{chp:disc}

In this chapter the project will evaluated and discussed.

The implementation is developed to evaluate on the assignment given. The developed project can transfer an image without compression and with a 1, 2 and 4-bit compression. The implementation is focused on analyzing the difference in energy consumption when using compression.  As the project has focused on the given assignment it is still possible to optimize the application for the use in a wireless sensor network.  

In this project radio communication and serial communication is always turned on. To lower the energy consumption when not using the radio and serial communication these should be turned off. This could be done by scheduling when to transfer the data. This scheduling could also be used for the sender mote and receiver to go into idle state. 

In the implementation an acknowledge is sent after receiving 1024 decompressed bytes. Implementing a negative-acknowledgment when for example receiving a package out order would an improvement to the project. 

Even though some improvements have been identified the implementation has been able to solve both basic requirements and advanced study. The image has been transferred with and without compression using 1, 2 and 4-bit compression. 

The measured results showed that compression could significantly lower the energy consumption . The results showed that this was due to the lower transmission time and difference in power was approximately the same. No compression compared to 4-bit compression showed a lower energy consumption of

noter
%- Konsekvens af write-once model i flash -> langsomt at slette
-Compression når vi bruger mere advanceret algoritmer vil større energy consumption, og derfor vil compression/decompression ikke altid kunne betale sig. Det vigtigt at vurdere energy forbruger på compression/decompression vs radio communication når man vælger algoritme.
Mere complexitet i udregning = mere energy forbrug.

Ved et færdig implementeret system bør man schedule sender og modtager, så de kan gå idle, når de ikke skal sender eller modtager.
