This report and the developed image compression and transmission project solves the assignment given in the \emph{mini-project 6} in the course \emph{Wireless Sensor Network and Electronics}.

The project which has been developed can be used for compressing images on a TelosB mote. It must also be able to sent the image from a PC to the TelosB mote, and pass it to antoher TelosB mote, and then back to a PC where the image will be reconstructed. Between the two motes a compression/decompression will be applied. The energy consumption with and without the compression/decompression will be measured to analyze the energy consumtion.

This report will explain the theory of the project. Furthermore the implementation will be given along with the results, which will be discussed.
