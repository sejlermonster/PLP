This report and the developed image compression and transmission prohect solves the assignment given in the \emph{mini-project 6} in the course \emph{Wireless Sensor Network and Electronics}.

The project which has been developed can be used for compressing images on a TelosB mote. It must also be able to sent the image from a PC to the TelosB mote, and pass it to antoher TelosB mote, where the image will be reconstructed. An analysis will be made to examine the energy consumption in the TelosB motes, with and without the compression.

This report will explain the theory of the project. Furthermore different implementation examples will be given along with the results, which will be discussed.
