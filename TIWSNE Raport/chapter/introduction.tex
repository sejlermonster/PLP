\label{chp:intro}

This report and the developed image compression and transmission project solves the assignment given in the \emph{mini-project 6} in the course \emph{Wireless Sensor Network and Electronics}.

The project concerns with transferring an image between two TelosB motes. The image will be transferred both with and without compression. Three different lossy compression algorithms has been developed and implemented on the TelosB motes. 

This report will explain the theory of the project. Furthermore it will analyze energy consumption, present the results and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using compression.
